# wall-drawing

Wall drawing procedurally generates a Sol LeWitt / Tom Sachs style wall drawing that will adhere to the following rules:

* Draw a line as close as you can to the one above it without touching.
* If you touch the line, your turn is over.
* If you lift your pencil, your turn is over.
* If you get to the end, your turn is over.
